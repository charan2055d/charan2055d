# Hi, I'm Narupalli Venkata Sai Charan reddy 👋

I'm a 1-st year EEE student at IIT Dharwad learning AI step by step and building skills to become an LLM + RAG + Generative AI engineer.

### 🚀 What I'm doing right now
- Learning Python deeply  
- Building mini coding projects  
- Uploading everything to GitHub to stay consistent  
- Understanding data, logic, and clean code  

### 🎯 My long-term direction
Become a highly skilled engineer working on:

- Fine-tuning AI models  
- Generative AI apps  

### 📚 What you’ll see in my GitHub
- ✅ Python projects  
- ✅ ML models (coming soon)  
- ✅ Deep Learning / CNN projects (3rd year)  
- ✅ LLM and RAG bots (3rd–4th year)  
- ✅ Full-stack AI apps (4th year)  

### 🔧 Technologies I'm learning
Python | NumPy | Pandas | Matplotlib | Git | ML | DL | Transformers | HuggingFace | RAG | FastAPI | Docker
